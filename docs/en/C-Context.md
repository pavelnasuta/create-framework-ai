# üß† C - Context

**Goal**: To define the emotional core of the product and its fundamental idea. At this stage, we form the values that will guide the AI in the development process and user interaction. This is a deep dive into the idea that allows the AI to "feel" the essence of the problem.

## 1. Vision & Mission

-   **What it is**: This is not just a line on a website, but a guiding star for the entire project. You formulate the fundamental problem you are solving and the transformation the user undergoes.
-   **How it works**: The mission gives the AI an ethical brief: it must be supportive and unbiased.
-   **Example**: "Our mission is to democratize access to healthy eating by turning the routine of cooking into a creative and inspiring process."

## 2. Core Values

-   **What it is**: The key principles that will become the "ethical code" for the AI. These values determine how the neural network will generate content and interact with the user.
-   **Example**: If a value is simplicity, the AI should not provide complex recipes.

## 3. The Emotional Problem

-   **What it is**: Instead of a specific task ("create a recipe app"), you focus on the emotion behind that task.
-   **How it works**: This allows the AI to create deeper and more personalized solutions, rather than just providing a generic response.
-   **Example**: "The user doesn't just want to find something to cook; they feel overwhelmed and exhausted when standing in front of an empty fridge."
