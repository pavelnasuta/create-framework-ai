**Goal**: To scale the product and business. The AI becomes your strategic partner in matters of growth and monetization. At this stage, we move from tactical improvements to strategic decisions.

## 1. LTV & CAC Optimization

-   **What it is**: Optimizing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and reducing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
-   **How it works**: The AI analyzes user behavior to optimize LTV and reduce CAC. It can predict LTV for different audience segments and offer personalized retention proposals.

## 2. Growth & Monetization Strategies

-   **What it is**: Developing growth and monetization strategies.
-   **How it works**: The AI generates hundreds of versions of ad texts, headlines, and creatives to find the most effective ones for different platforms. It can also suggest new monetization models that do not conflict with our values.

## 3. Automated Iteration

-   **What it is**: Setting up a system where the AI will not only track metrics but also suggest hypotheses for growth, allowing the product to evolve almost on its own.
-   **How it works**: The AI becomes a self-learning system. It doesn't just perform tasks; it learns how to make the product better, based on real data.
