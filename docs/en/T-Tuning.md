# üîß T - Tuning

**Goal**: To validate the product and find growth opportunities. At this stage, we launch the MVP, collect data, and analyze it with AI to understand what works and what doesn't. The AI becomes your business analyst, capable of finding insights in large volumes of information.

## 1. AARRR Analysis

-   **What it is**: Analyzing user behavior through the AARRR funnel (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue).
-   **How it works**: The AI processes data to identify where users are encountering problems in the funnel. For example, it can determine that we have a high registration rate but low activation, indicating a problem with onboarding.

## 2. User Feedback Analysis

-   **What it is**: Analyzing user feedback obtained from surveys, reviews, or interviews.
-   **How it works**: The AI assistant systematizes and analyzes qualitative data, identifying the most frequent requests, pain points, and wishes. This allows us to make decisions based on real user opinions, not on guesswork.

## 3. AI-Driven A/B Testing

-   **What it is**: Automated testing of different versions of the interface and texts to improve key metrics.
-   **How it works**: The AI independently creates and tests hypotheses, for example, changing headlines or button colors. It doesn't just run the test; it learns from the results to suggest the most effective options.
