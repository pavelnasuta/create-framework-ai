# üèóÔ∏è A - Assembly

**Goal**: To build a scalable product by assembling all the ready-made components. At this stage, we move to actual development, but with a focus on efficiency. The AI will act as a co-pilot, helping with code generation, content, and even the business plan.

## 1. Code & Content Generation

-   **What it is**: Automated generation of code, texts, images, and other materials for the product.
-   **How it works**: The AI assistant, based on our prompts, generates ready-to-use code for interface components, writes persuasive texts, creates images and icons, which significantly speeds up the process.

## 2. Business Goals & Metrics

-   **What it is**: Formulating specific business goals and key metrics for the MVP.
-   **How it works**: The AI helps us translate our Vision and Mission into measurable indicators. For example, the number of active users, LTV, or CAC.

## 3. No-Code Assembly Plan

-   **What it is**: A plan for assembling the MVP using No-Code tools, if applicable.
-   **How it works**: The AI assistant can suggest optimal No-Code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Webflow) and create a step-by-step plan for building the product on them.
