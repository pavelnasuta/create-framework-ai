# üî¨ R - Research

**Goal**: To shift from intuition to data. This stage helps you and the AI assistant gather information about the market, competitors, users, and their needs. The AI will act as an analyst, helping to identify patterns and insights.

## 1. Market Research

-   **What it is**: Gathering data about the market size, its dynamics, and trends. The AI assistant helps systematize this information, identify untapped niches, and potential risks.
-   **How it works**: The AI processes vast amounts of information from open sources and prepares a structured report.

## 2. Competitive Analysis

-   **What it is**: A deep analysis of direct and indirect competitors. The AI identifies their strengths and weaknesses, analyzes their product strategy and positioning.
-   **How it works**: The AI assistant creates a detailed "competitive brief" that includes a SWOT analysis and helps define our unique selling proposition (USP).

## 3. User Research

-   **What it is**: Gathering data about potential users. The AI helps identify their main pain points, needs, and expectations for the product.
-   **How it works**: Using data from interviews, surveys, or open sources, the AI assistant generates a report on what users actually need.

## 4. User Archetypes

-   **What it is**: Creating detailed portraits of ideal users based on the data collected in previous stages.
-   **How it works**: The AI forms "user archetypes," including their demographics, motivations, pain points, and goals. This makes the development process more focused and personalized.
