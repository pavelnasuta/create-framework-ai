# üß© E - Elaboration

**Goal**: To rapidly test hypotheses with AI and No-Code tools. At this stage, we move from theoretical concepts to practical implementation. The AI will help us quickly generate prototypes that can be shown to users to validate our hypotheses.

## 1. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

-   **What it is**: Instead of focusing on features, we define the "jobs" that the user "hires" our product to do. This allows us to create solutions that truly solve a problem.
-   **How it works**: The AI helps formulate hypotheses about which "jobs" need to be done for each archetype, based on their pain points and needs.

## 2. Prototyping AARRR

-   **What it is**: Creating prototypes aimed at validating specific metrics from the AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue). Instead of creating a full-fledged product, we quickly build a "skeleton" to test one or two key hypotheses.
-   **How it works**: The AI generates content and structure for landing pages, onboarding flows, or even emails that can be quickly assembled on No-Code platforms.

## 3. MVP Generation

-   **What it is**: Based on validated hypotheses, we create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This is no longer just a prototype but a working product that can be released to the first users.
-   **How it works**: The AI helps create an MVP plan, including a list of features, the user journey, and even technical requirements.
