# üöÄ CREATE: An AI-Powered Framework for Web Product Development

**CREATE** is a versatile, flexible methodology that turns a chaotic idea into a profitable and scalable web service.

The framework is designed for teams aiming for **fast iteration** and wanting to use AI platforms to transform an idea into a product with minimal time and financial costs.

## General Overview of the Methodology

CREATE is not just a collection of prompts‚Äîit‚Äôs a holistic methodology that transforms a chaotic idea into a profitable and scalable web service, with artificial intelligence as the central tool. It was designed to tackle one of the biggest challenges when working with large language models (LLMs): the loss of context.

Neural networks, especially when handling complex, multi-stage tasks, often operate "in the moment." They can generate brilliant text or code for a single prompt but forget the details and nuances mentioned earlier. This leads to fragmentation, loss of logic, and, as a result, the creation of disjointed, non-viable "artifacts" instead of a cohesive product.

CREATE solves this problem by turning the process into a unified, consistent chain. It‚Äôs like a thread of product strategy onto which we string beads of artifacts. Each "bead" is the result of working on one of the framework‚Äôs stages (e.g., mission, values, competitor analysis). Most importantly, each subsequent prompt uses the outputs of the previous one as its inputs. This way, the AI model constantly "remembers" the accumulated context, and each new step flows organically from the previous one.

## ‚ú® Core Principles

-   **AI-Driven**: AI acts not just as a tool but as a full-fledged partner at every stage of development, from market analysis to business metric optimization.
-   **Fast Iteration**: We believe in quickly testing hypotheses using No-Code and AI tools to find a working idea before investing resources in full-scale development.
-   **Community-Powered**: The framework is a living organism that is constantly evolving. We, like you, are a team of enthusiasts who are constantly looking for new ways to apply AI in product development. Your suggestions, edits, and new ideas for prompts are what will allow our framework to grow and adapt to the ever-changing world of technology.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The framework consists of six sequential yet flexible stages, each with its own goal and set of prompts for an AI assistant:

1.  **[C - Context](docs/en/C-Context.md)**: Define the emotional core of the product and its fundamental idea.
2.  **[R - Research](docs/en/R-Research.md)**: Shift from intuition to data.
3.  **[E - Elaboration](docs/en/E-Elaboration.md)**: Rapidly test hypotheses with AI and No-Code tools.
4.  **[A - Assembly](docs/en/A-Assembly.md)**: Build a scalable product by assembling all the ready-made components.
5.  **[T - Tuning](docs/en/T-Tuning.md)**: Validate the product and find growth opportunities.
6.  **[E - Expansion](docs/en/E-Expansion.md)**: Scale the product and business, making AI a strategic partner.

## ü§ù Contributing

We are open to all suggestions and improvements. If you have ideas for improving prompts, new prompts, or suggestions for the structure, please read our guide on how to contribute: **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

Let's build the future of product development together!
