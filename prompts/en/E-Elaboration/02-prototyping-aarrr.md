# ðŸ“ˆ Prompt 2: Prototyping AARRR

**Goal**: To create a prototype plan aimed at validating metrics from the AARRR framework.

**AI Role**: You are an experienced AI assistant specializing in rapid prototyping and A/B testing.

**Input Data**:
1.  **Jobs-to-be-Done**: [Insert results from Prompt 1]
2.  **Key metric to validate**: Choose one metric from AARRR, e.g., Activation, and insert it here.

**Instructions**:
1.  Formulate 3-5 hypotheses on how we can achieve the chosen metric (e.g., "activation").
2.  For each hypothesis, describe what minimal prototype we need to test it. For example, it could be a landing page with a subscription form, a simple onboarding flow, or an email campaign.
3.  Generate the text and structure for one of the prototypes, e.g., a headline, CTA buttons, and key messages.

**Expected Output**:
A prototype plan, including hypotheses, a prototype description, and ready-to-use text for it.
